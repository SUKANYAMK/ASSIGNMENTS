<br>

<p>A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmatic or logical operations.Since a sequence of operations readily changed, thecomputer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>

<h3><a name="cpu">cpu</a></h3>

<p>A Central Processing Unit(CPU) also referred to as a central processor unit, is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmatical, logical, and input/output operations of the system.The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960's.The form, design and implementation of CPU's have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains much the same.</p>

<h3><a name="alu">ALU</a></h3>

<p>In computing, arithmatic and logic unit(ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithmatic and logical operations.The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer, and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers.The processors found inside modern CPUs and graphics processing units(GPUs) accomodate very powerful and very complex ALU's; a single component may contain a number of ALUs.</p>

<h2><a name="pg">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</a></h2>
<a href="#top">GO TO TOP</a>
<p>A programming language is a formal language designed to communicate instructions to amachine,particularly a computer.Programming languages can be used to create programs that control tha behavior of a machine and/or to express algorithm precisely.</p>

<h3><a name="c++">C<sup>++</sup></a></h3>

<p>C++(pronounced see plus plus)is a programming language that is a generel purpose statically typed, free form, multi-paradigm and compiled.It is regarded as an intermediate-level language, as it comprises both high-level and low level language featuers</p>

<h3><a name="c">C</a></h3>

<p>
C is the one of the most widely used programming languages of all time, and c compilers are available for majority of available compiter architectures and operating systems.</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="dbms">DBMS</a></h2>
<a href="#top">GO TO TOP</a>
<br>
<p>
A database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.</p>
<h3><a name="rdbms">RDBMS</a></h3>
<p>
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as invented by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory.</p>
<h3><a name="oodbms">OODBMS</a></h3>
<p>
An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.</p>
